# Challenge 1: Code Refractoring README

## Motivation for refractoring page

My motivation for refractoring this page was to challenge myself by applying new knowledge that I've obtained about HTML and CSS to make this page a more organized and easier to read version of itself.

## Problem solving

This project allows for a more user accessible webpage by adding sematic elements, alt attributes, and more description to elements. This will allow those with disabilities, such as blindness, with a screen reader to have a much easier time navigating the page.

## What I learned

I learned how to better organize my code to make it easier to follow and look back on if any mistakes are caught later down the road. I also learned how to figure out little fixes here and there through repetition and messing it up a couple times.

## What makes this project stand out?

Not only is this project well organized and well consolidated, I also added a favicon.
